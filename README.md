# üéµ Next.js Music Player

A beautiful, modern music player built with Next.js, featuring:

-   **Synced lyrics** with precise timing (using `@stef-0012/synclyrics`)
-   **High-quality album art** and rich metadata (from MusicBrainz & Cover Art Archive)
-   **Drag & drop or click-to-upload** MP3s with instant metadata/lyrics prefetch
-   **Duplicate prevention** (no double songs by title-artist)
-   **Responsive progress bar** with loading state
-   **Modern, responsive UI** with dark/light themes

---

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Upload MP3s**: Drag & drop or click to upload. Metadata is auto-extracted and enhanced via MusicBrainz.
-   **Synced Lyrics**: Fetches and displays time-synced lyrics for each track, with smooth highlighting.
-   **Album Art**: Always attempts to fetch the highest-quality cover art from Cover Art Archive, falling back to a placeholder if not found.
-   **Metadata Prefetch**: All metadata and lyrics are fetched in the background as soon as a song is uploaded.
-   **No Duplicates**: Prevents adding the same song (by title-artist) more than once.
-   **Progress Bar**: Visually tracks playback, handles loading/unknown duration gracefully.
-   **Playlist**: Click any track to play instantly. Playlist updates as you upload more music.
-   **Lyrics Fullscreen**: Expand lyrics to fullscreen for karaoke-style experience.
-   **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between beautiful dark and light modes.
